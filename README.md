## Black / White Dithering

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fdb/webcam-dither/master/.github/screenshot.jpg)

This code implements the dithering algorithm designed by [Bill Atkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither#Algorithms) in JavaScript. The code was ported from [Processing](https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2012/dithering/).

This repo also contains a half-finished [Rust implementation](https://github.com/fdb/webcam-dither/tree/master/ditherify) â€” I'm still working out the kinks!
